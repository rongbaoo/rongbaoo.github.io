<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in the Joint Training Program between Fudan University (FDU) and Shanghai AI Laboratory, under the supervision of [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RwlJNLcAAAAJ&hl=en), and I expect to graduate in 2027. Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Fudan University, where I graduated and obtained my Bachelor’s degree in 2022 under the guidance of [Prof. Qi Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XfqR3yYAAAAJ&hl=en). I sincerely appreciate the invaluable guidance, support, and inspiration that all my mentors have provided throughout my academic journey.

I have authored or co-authored more than ten papers published in top-tier international journals and conferences, including IEEE TPAMI, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR and ACL. My current research interests focus on reinforcement learning (RL) for generative large language models (LLMs), specifically including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), reasoning RL, and agentic RL. My earlier research mainly centered on the inference robustness of discriminative language models.

📧 I am open to collaboration and welcome inquiries from anyone interested in my research topics. Feel free to reach out via <font color="#0D4884"> rbao2018@outlook.com </font> or <font color="#0D4884"> rbao22@m.fudan.edu.cn</font>.
